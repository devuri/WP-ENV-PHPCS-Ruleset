# WP-ENV-PHPCS Ruleset

Welcome to the WP-ENV-PHPCS ruleset repository! This readme will guide you through understanding and using the ruleset effectively. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.

## Introduction

The WP-ENV-PHPCS ruleset is designed to help you write clean, secure, and efficient code for WordPress projects. It enforces coding standards and best practices specific to WordPress development. By following these standards, you can contribute to maintaining a consistent codebase across the project.

## Excluded Patterns

The ruleset excludes certain file patterns from analysis to focus on relevant code. It skips files in the following directories:

- `bin`: Typically contains executable files.
- `tests`: Contains files related to testing.
- `vendor`: Contains third-party libraries and dependencies.

These exclusions help speed up the analysis process and prevent false positives. Be mindful of these exclusions, but don't worry too much about them for now.

## Arguments

The ruleset includes some predefined arguments that control how the analysis is performed:

- `basepath`: Specifies the base path for analysis. It is currently set to the current directory, which is where the ruleset.xml file resides.
- `parallel`: Sets the number of parallel jobs for the analysis. It is currently set to 75, which means multiple files are analyzed simultaneously for faster results.
- `-p`: Enables progress reporting during the analysis, so you can see the analysis status.

These arguments are already set up for optimal performance. You can use them as is, without worrying about changing them for now.

## Included Rules

The ruleset includes several rules that enforce coding standards and best practices. Some important rules to be aware of are:

- `Internal.NoCodeFound`: This rule doesn't generate warnings for files that don't contain any code. It avoids unnecessary noise when analyzing empty files or configuration files.
- `WordPress.PHP.IniSet.display_errors_Blacklisted`: This rule generates a warning for the use of `IniSet` related to `display_errors`. It helps identify potential security risks.
- `Internal.LineEndings.Mixed`: This rule ignores warnings for mixed line-endings. It prevents unnecessary warnings caused by line-ending inconsistencies.
- `Internal.Tokenizer.Exception`: This rule suppresses warnings for internal exceptions, which are often found in minified files. It prevents false positive warnings in such cases.

There are other rules included as well, each serving a specific purpose. It's essential to review and understand these rules to maintain code quality.

## Configuration

The ruleset's configuration section contains additional settings and exclusions for specific rules. It's important to understand these settings to interpret the analysis results correctly. Some exclusions are marked for future fixes or are not applicable to your project. You can uncomment or modify these exclusions based on your project's requirements.

## Usage

To use the WP-ENV-PHPCS ruleset and analyze your code, follow these steps:

1. Install PHP CodeSniffer (PHPCS) if you haven't already. Ask your team lead or mentor for guidance if needed.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the `ruleset.xml` file from the repository to your WordPress project's root directory. This is usually the main folder of your project.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's root directory using the `cd` command.
5. Run the PHPCS analysis by executing the following command:

   ```
   phpcs --standard=ruleset.xml .
   ```

   This command tells PHPCS to use the WP-ENV-PHPCS ruleset (`ruleset.xml`) and analyze the current directory (`.`) and its sub

directories.

6. Once the analysis completes, review the results displayed in the terminal. Pay attention to any warnings or errors reported by PHPCS.

   - Warnings suggest areas of improvement, such as code style violations.
   - Errors indicate significant issues that need immediate attention, such as critical security vulnerabilities.

7. Address the warnings and errors based on the defined rules and exclusions. Consult with your team lead or mentor if you need help understanding or resolving any reported issues.

Remember, the goal of using the ruleset is to improve your code quality gradually. Don't worry if you encounter many warnings or errors initially. It takes time to get accustomed to the coding standards and best practices.

## Version Compatibility

The WP-ENV-PHPCS ruleset requires a minimum supported WordPress version of 4.7. Ensure that your project meets this requirement to utilize the ruleset effectively.

## Contributing
